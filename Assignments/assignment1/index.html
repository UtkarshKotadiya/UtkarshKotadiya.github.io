        <h1> Lionel Messi </h1>
        <p> Lionel Messi is a professional soccer player from Argentina. He is considered one of the best
            players to ever play the sport by many, even though as a child, he had a growth deficiency 
            would have cost a lot of money to treat. But, the large and famous soccer club FC Barcelona
            offered him a playing contract and aided him in treatment. He then played a majority of his career
            at FC Barcelona, becoming a legend of the club, the league, and the sport in general. Messi is 
            known to be one of the greatest of all time because of his playstyle and specific skillset.
        </p>
        <p> Though he is not physically strong or tall, like many other players, such as 
            Cristiano Ronaldo, who is often compared with him for the title of the best of all time, Messi's
            unique physical and athletic abilities are what make him the player he is. At the height of 5'7",
            his low center of gravity allows his to be extremely agile and swift, allowing him to slip past
            other players. Those abilities, in combination with his soccer IQ and genius, allows him to read
            the game and stay one step ahead of everyone else on the field. 
            Messi is one of the most creative, talented, and mesmerizing players to grace the world's most 
            popular sport.
