                    <h2> Store History </h2>
                    <p> Paramount Jewelers' history dates back to the early 2000s, when Mr. Frank
                        first got into the business through a kiosk in the mall called GoldNJewels.
                        After years of hard work and dedication, Mr. Frank opened a full fledged store
                        in the mall in 2009. And since then, Paramount Jewelers has been serving clients 
                        from all over with the utmost dedication and hospitality. Many of our clients 
                        exclusively shop jewelery only at Paramount Jewelers because of the outstanding
                        customer service and the focus on building a relationship with the client and not
                        seeing the process as a mere business transaction.
